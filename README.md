# Console game: Blackjack

![Game running](https://github.com/sagerg/cmsy168-final/blob/master/cover.png)

This project is a terminal/console based script simulating the logic of the game [Blackjack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack). Primarily written in Java.

## Purpose

This project was an exercise to observe and imitate programming concepts like OOP, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## Portability

It's portable enough.

## Why are there so many classes?

To demonstrate inheritance and polymorphism. Other than that, I would've used a map or a two dimensional list to store the details of several `Card Object`.

## How do I play?

All actions are going to be in the terminal. No GUI's **yet**.

```sh
$ cd blackjack-console
$ javac DRIVER.java
$ java DRIVER
```

## Todos
